# vscode-settings
For my development work, I primarily rely on Python. In case it's helpful, here are the settings and extensions I use with Visual Studio Code.
## Usage
In your work space
```bash
mkdir .vscode
cd .vscode 
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raywu60kg/vscode-settings/main/.vscode/settings.json
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raywu60kg/vscode-settings/main/.vscode/extensions.json
```
